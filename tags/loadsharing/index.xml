      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LoadBalancing is a crucial feature to increase the availability and reduce the time to complete a failover for IT services. In the first moment it seems to be not to complex. You have multiple instances of your service and you forward the traffic to both of those instances to share the load.&#xA;But there a dozens of different applications and services with totally different requirements. Some of those applications are very simple and are dependent to local sessions or states inside a database. Other applications are stateless or the state is synced between the different instances.&#xA;Based on those requirements the following LoadBalancing features are a subset of the important features to understand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of you are using NSX for many years already and are aware of the different changes and improvements implemented in the last years.&#xA;I personally started with NSX in version 2.3 and one of the first important improvements I recognized is &amp;ldquo;MultiTEP&amp;rdquo; for edge nodes from type VM.  It was released with NSX 2.5 and officially added to the reference design guide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the way: The reference design guide is still a great resource to learn the design pricipals for NSX implementaions. This is especially interesting for those who might be new to NSX.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
